# Aspen-Cottage-Holidays
This is a web appplication that allows holiday goers to plan their Aspen holidays. 

## The Process
The application was a fun build. With this application there were alot of different technologies that needed to be used to achieve the target product. There was alot of co-operation with fellow developers and reference to react documentations was key to completion. On the last day I had challenges with value from options being inherited by a select tag value which affected the application's ability to use select tags effectively. 

## Overview
A holiday goer is able to add the holdicay home they want to stay at and select from some activities within the viscinity of the cabins.

## Version 2
In my second version I would love to be able to make my activities page create, read update and delete. An actual log in would be an important addition.
